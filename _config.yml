I started my Ph.D. at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro in August 2018, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P0-eVQQAAAAJ&hl=en"target="_blank">Prof. Rodrigo C. de Lamare</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_XSJTowAAAAJ&hl=en"target="_blank">Prof. VÃ­tor H. Nascimento</a>. I am currently working on energy-efficient techniques in Adaptive IoT networks and federated learning.
